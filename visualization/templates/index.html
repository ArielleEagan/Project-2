            <h2>Rationale</h2>
            <p>As future Data Science and STEM professionals, we wanted to learn more about the job market and
                earning potential in various available roles. This chart compares the salaries of data scientists at
                several large tech companies based on years of experience and level of their position. Companies may
                be toggled on and off to compare only select companies or to look at individual companies
                information. Order at the top is based on number of entries in the dataset, largest to smallest (L
                to R).</p>

                <p>The source of the data, <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>, aggregates salary
                    information for a variety of tech positions from a wide range of companies utilizing user-submitted
                    information. As we explored the data, we found that this reliance on user input caused inconsistency
                    in much of the data (i.e. L7 and l7 for the same level of position). In addition, each company uses
                    different identifiers for different job levels. As a result of the complexity this adds for cleaning
                    the data, we elected to compare only Data Scientist positions at the five companies with the largest
                    number of entries in the
                    dataset.</p>

                <p>Having made this decision, we invested much time in researching the classification systems for
                    each
                    of the five companies, and divided each level of employee into one of three buckets. As much as
                    possible, we attempted to group each companies levels into like buckets.</p>
                <p>This is the breakdown of the buckets:</p>
